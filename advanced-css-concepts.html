            <h2>Rationale for creating this tutorial, plus things to consider</h2>
            <p>
                Upon reviewing the current course material, as well as reviewing
                some of the feedback for week 1, I felt that it would be beneficial to
                make bonus CSS content for those who wish to take their
                understanding of CSS to the next level. I want to stress that this material is optional in the context 
                of the assignments you will do for the HTML-CSS-Javascript course. However, gaining a solid understanding of the information on this page
                will help you understand the concepts that are taught in the Bootstrap course more easily, as well as giving you an advantage over your 
                colleagues.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would strongly encourage you all to edit the files on this page, as well as the css files that are referenced
                on this page, as much as you'd like. One of the best ways to develop your skills as a web developer (regardless of whether you 
                choose to do front-end or full-stack) is to inspect and edit files, and attempt to reverse
                engineer code that you find online. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'd also like to mention that while this page is overall responsive (meaning that it can adjust 
                its layout based on the viewport of a device), this page is meant to be experienced on a desktop so that you have access to the inspect tools
                for your browser. If you're unsure how to do this, type "how to inspect element in browser-name", and you should be able to find helpful resources.

            <h2><a href="#">#</a> CSS Box Model</h2>
            <p>
                CSS Positioning allows you to change the position from the
                normal flow of the CSS box model (which consists of the contents,
                padding, border, and margin respectively). There are also 4 more aspects to the box model: top, bottom, left
                and right. These represent the outermost boundaries of an HTML element. The box model can be visualized as:
            </p>
            <img src="images/css box model.png" class="image-block css-box-model" alt="diagram of css box model" width="550" />
            <p>
                Notice that the innermost rectangle in the box model is referring to the content (i.e. the information that's inside of the start and end tags). 
                The padding refers to the space that separates the content from the potentially visible boundary. This 
                visible boundary is referred to as the border. The margin refers to the spacing that is 
                outside of the visible border. If we apply the following class to the next p element:
                <code>
                    .box-model-example {<br>
                        <span class="indentation"></span>padding: 10px;<br>
                        <span class="indentation"></span>border-top: 10px solid green;<br>
                        <span class="indentation"></span>border-bottom: 10px solid blue;<br>
                        <span class="indentation"></span>border-left: 10px solid indigo;<br>
                        <span class="indentation"></span>border-right: 10px solid violet;<br>
                        <span class="indentation"></span>margin: 10px;<br>
                      }
                </code>
            </p>
            <p class="box-model-example">Here you can see how the border surrounds the padding and the content of this p element. Go inside the inspector of your browser
                in order to see the outermost boundary of the element. You will notice that the margin is colored orange by the browser if you're using Chrome.
                Feel free to play around with this class to see how the margin relates to the padding, and vice versa.
                But did you know that you can do this (perpare for voodoo magic in the next section)?:

                height="600"
            />
            <p>
                But this is all pure CSS, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCEIAlt5BHk" target="_blank">believe it</a>!
                The way these rectangles are rendered is by setting either the width or the height property to 0.

            <p> 
                This causes the content to be either one dimensional (essentially turning the content into a line), or zero dimensional (effectively turning the content
                into a single point). However, this doesn't affect the visibility of the border property. If you noticed in the previous section, you saw diagonal lines 
                that went from one of the vertices of the content to either the top, bottom, left, or right points of the element; I intentionally used different colors
                for the borders in order to highlight this more effectively. What's happening here is that the 
                diagonal lines are converging because the content is either a point or a line.

                Woah! Is that the American flag? Yep, all of this was created using CSS, SVG, and a powerful css feature called Flexbox. This flag
                is rendered with relative positioning, absolite positioning, and a few features from Flexbox. But before we discuss the flag in depth,
                let's discuss what each position property value does.
            </p>
            <p>

                    <li><a href="#static" id="staticLink">static</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#relative" id="relativeLink">relative</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#absolute" id="absoluteLink">absolute</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#fixed" id="fixedLink">fixed</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#sticky" id="stickyLink">sticky</a></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <section id="static">
                <h1><a href="#staticLink">^</a> Static Positioning</h1>
                <p>
                    HTML elements have a static position by default. This means that the elements will be positioned in the order as they appear in the document.
                    Elements that have static positioning can not be altered with the top, bottom, left, or right properties.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="relative">
                <h1><a href="#relativeLink">^</a> Relative Positioning</h1>
                <p>
                    HTML elements that are set with relative positioning will initially be positioned as they appear in the document, but they are able to be changed
                    with the top, bottom, left, and right properties. Recall that the top, bottom, left, and right properties refer to the outermost points of
                    an elements box model. That is, these properties are located at the corners of where the margin ends.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="absolute">
                <h1><a href="#absoluteLink">^</a> Absolute Positioning</h1>
                <p>
                    Here is where things can get tricky. HTML elements that have absolute positioning are positioned in relation to the nearest ancestor
                    that also has a non-static position. If an absolutely positioned element have no ancestor that has a non-static position, the element is 
                    positioned in relation to the browser window at the top.  
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="fixed">
                <h1><a href="#fixedLink">^</a> Fixed Positioning</h1>
                <p>
                    This is similar to the absolutely positioned element in that is relative to the browser window, except that the element doesn't move when the
                    user scrolls up and down. If you look into the source code, the element that displays the orange circle on the bottom right is right 
                    below this p element.
                </p>
                <a href="#"><div class="fixed-example">Home</div></a>
            </section>
            <section id="sticky">
                <h1><a href="#stickyLink">^</a> Sticky Positioning</h1>
                This positions an element with relative positioning until the scroll bar is on the same level. This position is typically used for header styles.
            </section>
        <p>
            Now that I've explained what each position value does, let's analyze the CSS/SVG/Flexbox flag class by class. Here is the styling for the flag class:
        </p>
        <code>
            .flag {<br>
                <span class="indentation"></span>position: relative;<br>
                <span class="indentation"></span>width: 100%;<br>
                <span class="indentation"></span>height: 65vh;<br>
                <span class="indentation"></span>margin: 2% 0;<br>
              }
        </code>
        <p>
            The flag class is set to a position of relative,  meaning that it has its normal flow, unless we set the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
            But here, we aren't setting those properties. Why, you ask? It's because we are going to use an absolutely positioned element inside of the flag element, and 
            remember that an absolutely positioned element's top, bottom, left, and right properties are based on its nearest non-statically positioned element. The width is 
            set to 100%, which means it will horizontally span the entirely of its parent element's width.  Height is set to 65 vh, which means that it will vertically span 65% 
            of the viewport's height; the viewport refers to the portion of the browser that is visible to the user. Now let's take a look at the stripe class:
        </p>
        <code>
            .flag-strip {<br>
                <span class="indentation"></span>width: 100%<br>
                <span class="indentation"></span>height: 7.6923%;<br>
            }
            <br><br>
            .flag-strip:nth-child(odd) {<br>
                <span class="indentation"></span>background-color: red;<br>
            }
            <br><br>
            .flag-strip:nth-child(even) {<br>
                <span class="indentation"></span>background-color: white;<br>
            }
        </code>
        <p>
            The top class has a width of 100%, which will span the entire width of the parent's width. The height is set to 7.6923% because that is the result of 1 / 13. 
            Since there are 13 strips in the American flag, the total height of all the 13 strip classes will equal to 100%. The nth-child(odd) pseudoclass applies a red 
            background to the odd numbered children (that is, the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and so on element will have a red background).
        </p>
        <code>
            .blue-field {<br>
                <span class="indentation"></span>position: absolute;<br>
                <span class="indentation"></span>top: 0;<br>
                <span class="indentation"></span>left: 0;<br>
                <span class="indentation"></span>z-index: 10000;<br>
                <span class="indentation"></span>width: 40%;<br>
                <span class="indentation"></span>height: 53.8%;<br>
                <span class="indentation"></span>background: blue;<br>
              }
        </code>
        <p>
            Here, we set the top and left properties to zero because we want the blue field element to sit at the top left edge of the element (therefore mimicking
            the look of the American flag). The z-index is also a property that is only available to non-statically positioned elements, and what it does is set the overlay order
            of elements. So the higher the z-index value is, the more likely that element will render on top of other elements, which is why the blue field class is over the red 
            and white strips. If we set the z-index to a negative, the blue field will appear beneath the red and white strips. The z-index doesn't have to be 10000, but it is 
            common practice to set z-index values really high values to ensure that unintentioned elements don't override the z-index.

        <section id="flex-box" class="cssp-container">
            <h2><a href="#">#</a> CSS Flexbox</h2>
            <p>
                CSS has a very powerful tool called Flexbox. This allows content to be layed out in the form of rows and columns. To use Flexbox, set the display property
                to flex. Once you enable Flexbox, you can now use the other flex properties. The properties that this page will use are: flex-flow and justify-content. flex-flow
                is a shorthand for two flex properties: flex-direction and flex-wrap. Flex-direction determines what direction the items inside of a flex container will render. The 
                default value is row (meaning the items will be rendered left to right); other values are column, reverse-column, reverse-row. The flex-direction property determines what 
                is the "main axis" of a container. Flex-wrap determines if the items need to be wrapped once the end of the container's width is reached. 
                By default, flex-wrap tries to fit all the items on one row. Justify-content aligns items on the main axis. So in our case, the main axis is row, so the 
                justify-content property will apply from left to right. If flex-direction was set to column, then justify-content would apply from top-to-bottom.
                Now let's dive into our Flexbox classes.
            </p>
            <code>
                .star-row {<br>
                    <span class="indentation"></span>display: -webkit-box;<br>
                    <span class="indentation"></span>display: -ms-flexbox;<br>
                    <span class="indentation"></span>display: flex;<br>
                    <span class="indentation"></span>-webkit-box-orient: horizontal;<br>
                    <span class="indentation"></span>-webkit-box-direction: normal;<br>
                    <span class="indentation"></span>-ms-flex-flow: row wrap;<br>
                    <span class="indentation"></span>flex-flow: row wrap;<br>
                    <span class="indentation"></span>height: 11.1111%;<br>
                  }
            </code>
            <p>
                Most of the css rules you see here, you don't have to worry about. We will only focus on display:flex, flex-flow: row wrap, and height: 11.1111%.
                As stated above, setting display with the value of flex allows the browser to use Flexbox and gives us access to the other flex properties. You always want
                to put the display:flex rule on a container. The flex-flow property sets two flex properties at the same time: the left value sets flex-direction 
                to row, while the right value sets the flex-wrap property to wrap. The default value for flex-wrap is row nowrap. The height is set to 11.1111% because
                we need the height of the stars to take up 1/9th of the height of the blue field (since there are 9 rows of stars in the American flag). The other properties 
                were generated by a VS Code tool called Live Sass Compiler. This is somewhat outside of the scope of this course, so it you're interested in learning about
                SASS/SCSS, send me a message through Slack. 
            </p>
            <code>
                .star-row:nth-child(odd) {<br>
                    <span class="indentation"></span>justify-content: space-between;<br>
                }<br><br>
                
                .star-row:nth-child(odd) * {<br>
                    <span class="indentation"></span>width: 7%;<br>
                }<br><br>
                
                .star-row:nth-child(even) {<br>
                    <span class="indentation"></span>justify-content: space-around;<br>
                }<br><br>
                
                .star-row:nth-child(even) * {<br>
                    <span class="indentation"></span>width: 7%;<br>
                }
            </code>
            <p>
                The justify-content rule in combination of the nth-child pseudo class, is applying different spacing to mathc the American flag. The odd numbered 
                children have spaces between each item, while the even numbered items have spaces on both sides.
